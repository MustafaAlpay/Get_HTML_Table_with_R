# Get_HTML_Table_with_R
Welcome to the Get_HTML_Table_with_R wiki!

This is a simple repository to demonstrate how you can extract data from a HTML page.

The HTML table is something like this:

[Sample HTML Table](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mDXi79dRF8S1mx_PP7DUxd6myP8tE6j7/view?usp=sharing)

If you are using a MAC just like me, you can install R easily from terminal simply by:

brew tap homebrew/science
brew install r

or download installer package from https://www.r-project.org/

After installation on the terminal again type

R

to start R and install XML library with this command:

R CMD BATCH /users/mustafa_alpay/Desktop/html2R.R
